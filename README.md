# Direct Market Access Platform for Farmers

## Overview
Our project aims to empower farmers by providing them with a direct market access platform. This platform eliminates intermediaries, enabling farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, wholesalers, or businesses. By doing so, it ensures better profitability for farmers and fosters transparency and efficiency in agricultural trade.

## Features
- **Farmer Registration and Profile Management:** Allows farmers to create profiles and list their produce.
- **Market Listings:** Buyers can browse available produce, compare prices, and place orders.
- **Secure Payment Integration:** Ensures secure transactions between farmers and buyers.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Farmers can update stock availability, and buyers can get real-time notifications.
- **Rating and Feedback System:** Promotes trust and accountability between farmers and buyers.
- **Multilingual Support:** Accessible to farmers from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Payment Gateway:** [Specify the gateway used, e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, etc.]
- **Hosting:** [e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel]
